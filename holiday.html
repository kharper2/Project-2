      <h4>*Disclaimers*</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I will generally be looking at the major U.S. holidays that I like.</li>
        <li>Yes, I know this is biased, so please use your own judgment when it comes to my findings.</li>
        <li>If your judgement doesn't align with mine, I strongly suggest you to reconsider.</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="suspects">
      <h4>The suspects</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>New Year's Day</li>
        <li>MLK Jr. Day</li>
        <li>President's Day</li>
        <li>Easter Sunday</li>
        <li>Mother's Day</li>
        <li>Memorial Day</li>
        <li>Juneteenth</li>
        <li>Father's Day</li>
        <li>Independence Day</li>
        <li>Labor Day</li>
        <li>Indigenous People's Day</li>
        <li>Veterans Day</li>

    <section id="first-cut">
      <h4>The first cut</h4>
      <p>Objectively, the best holidays are the ones that result with the most time off of school/work.</p>
      <p>Summer doesn't count, it's time off. As a result, we eliminate Independence Day as it makes no difference in time off. </p>
      <p>This leaves us with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New Year's Day</li>
        <li>Easter Sunday</li>
        <li>Thanksgiving</li>
        <li>Christmas</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="second-cut">
      <h4>The second cut</h4>
      <p>I love fall and winter, so Easter is eliminated.</p>
      <p>There is so much hope and work that goes into planning for Christmas that once the day passes, I go into a mild seasonal depression. Goodbye New Years.</p>

    <section id="reveal">
      <h4>The reveal</h4>
      <p>Although Christmas has familial and religious importance, it is a holiday that many companies profit off of.</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, I love buying and receiving presents, but I believe that there is too much emphasis put on the materialistic side of this holiday.</p>
      <p>Therefore, because of the emphasis on family (or friends if Friendsgiving is your thing) the winner is Thanksgiving!</p>
      <p>Also the food is scrumptious.</p>
      <p>And most importantly, this year, it falls on my 18th birthday :)</p>
